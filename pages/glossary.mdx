This page defines various terms for creating a common understanding.

## Company passport

Trust framework (“Afsprakenstelsel”) to facilitate the exchange of verifiable
data about legal entities. [More info](https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en/use-cases-2/ondernemingspaspoort-1).

## Organizational wallet

Software component, acting on behalf of an organization (any legal entity),
capable of receiving and storing verifiable credentials (VCs), issuing
(generating) VCs, verifying VCs and presenting verifiable presentations (VPs)
based on those VCs. Most often a web based application that can be used
multiple persons within an organization. But may also be a mobile
(iOS/Android) app.

## Personal wallet(s)

Software component, acting on behalf of a natural person, capable of
receiving and storing verifiable credentials (VCs), issuing (generating) self-
issued VCs, verifying VCs and presenting verifiable presentations (VPs)
based on those VCs. Most often a mobile (iOS/Android) app but may also be
a web based application.

## Process Guidance System

In previous phases of the Company Passport project the term “Process
Guidance System” (PGS) has often been used. It refers to a web application
or mobile app that guides people through particular processes. For instance,
the founding of a company. During the process PGS application interacts with
organizational and/or personal wallets to request or exchange verifiable
credentials. From an architectural perspective a PGS application is
considered as any relying party system that is requesting the presentation of
particular verifiable credentials. In case a verifiable credential is not yet
available the PGS can redirect to issuers of the verifiable credential.
